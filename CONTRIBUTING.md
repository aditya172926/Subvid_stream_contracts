- Create a new branch from main in your local repository using `git checkout -b <new_branch_name> main`
- You can either use **Hardhat** or **Remix editor** to work on the Smart contracts

## Important Points while making a PR
- Do not push your your wallet's Secret phrase or private key in any part of the code
- The repository owner is NOT responsible if your wallet or anything related to that is compromised
- While pushing the updates in Smart contract, also update the ABI for that
